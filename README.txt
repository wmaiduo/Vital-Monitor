README

1. Begin by downloading the Gtk GUI kit by using the following command in Unix (Yes to all)...
    sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

2. To run...
    make -> Compiles files and executable called 'main;
    make test -> Runs the executable
    make clean -> Deletes all files generated from compilation if they exist
    NOTE: No .o files are created independently, the linker/loader work together in one command line.
